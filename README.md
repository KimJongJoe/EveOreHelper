# EveOreHelper
Tells you if you should compress your ores or leave them alone
simple little program i made. 

follow the directions included in the program.
if you delete an entry and the field is blank, enter a 0. 
if any of the fields are empty, the program will crash! 
this is due to there being no value when the equation is computed, i don't know how to fix it.

# EveOreHelper

A simple little program I made that tells you if you should Compress your ores or not. Follow the directions included in the program. If you delete an entry and the field is blank, enter a 0 OR THE PROGRAM WILL CRASH. If any of the fields are empty, THE PROGRAM WILL CRASH! This is due to there being no value when the equation is computed, I don't know how to fix it.
